# Immortal

A custom home-screen layer for discontinued Meta Portal devices — a play on *Portal*, and on
keeping it alive after Meta wound the platform down. Immortal turns a Portal into a device you
own: your launcher, your screensaver, and an app store that installs a curated catalog
on-device, with remote self-update so it improves over time without a cable.

Package: `com.immortal.launcher` · Target: Meta Portal — **Android 9** (API 28: the 2018 Portal /
Portal+ and the Portal TV) and **Android 10** (API 29: the 2019 and 2021 models), arm64, no Google
services. Touch models and the remote-driven **Portal TV** are both supported.

## What's in it

- **Launcher** (`HomeActivity`) — a fullscreen app grid with a clock/date/weather header and an
  optional charge indicator (shown only on Portal Go, which has a battery). A photo-style
  **Screensaver** button sits top-left; a **Manage** button bottom-right. Manage mode lets you
  remove apps (tap the ✕) and organise the grid into **folders** by dragging one app onto
  another — name them, rename them, and drag apps back out, just like a phone. A green **Calls**
  tile bridges to the stock dialer/contacts for WhatsApp and Messenger calling.
- **Screensaver** (`PhotoDreamService` / `PhotoFrameController`) — a photo frame with stock-style
  clock/battery/date/weather widgets. Point it at a folder of **your own photos and videos**, or
  use the keyless built-in feed (Lorem Picsum, Unsplash-ready); weather is keyless Open-Meteo + IP
  geolocation. It cooperates with the Portal's presence sensor so it runs as a **permanent frame**
  while someone's around (and on mains power), and on the battery-powered **Portal Go** an optional
  "sleep when nobody's around" setting saves power. Swipe to change photos, tap to exit.
- **App Store** (`StoreActivity` / `StoreCatalog`) — a hosted JSON catalog
  ([`catalog.json`](catalog.json), schema v2) rendered with app icons, search, per-app detail
  pages (author, source, website, credit), device-compatibility badges, and an "Updates" section
  for installed apps. F-Droid entries resolve the current APK at install time so the catalog never
  goes stale; your own apps use a direct `apkUrl`. **The store is open to community submissions** —
  every catalog PR is CI-validated. Built a Portal app? [Get it listed](SUBMISSIONS.md).
- **Help tour** (`HelpActivity`) — a friendly, non-technical walkthrough on a Help tile (and once
  on first launch), so anyone can pick up a revived Portal.
- **Portal TV support** — full remote/D-pad navigation across the whole UI, a Calls tile that
  bridges to the TV's stock home, and an Immortal tile that appears on that stock home so you can
  hop back.
- **Universal installer** — on the Gen-1 Portal+ (Android 9) the *built-in* Android installer
  dialog is broken (renders with no buttons), so sideloading normally fails. Immortal ships a
  shell-privileged silent-install daemon (started by the kit) that fixes this for the whole
  device: the store and self-update use it, an **"Install with Immortal"** handler
  (`ApkInstallActivity`) catches any APK you open from Chrome or a file manager (set it as the
  default and those installs go silent), and an **"Install an APK"** browser (`ApkBrowserActivity`)
  lists APKs in your Downloads. For Play-Store apps via **Aurora Store**, use Aurora's *Shizuku*
  installer together with Shizuku (`provision.sh --shizuku`) — see
  [Play-Store apps on a first-gen Portal](#play-store-apps-via-aurora-on-a-first-gen-portal) below;
  Aurora's own Session/Native installers can't get past the broken Gen-1 dialog. Newer Portals have
  a working installer and don't need any of this.
- **Self-update** (`UpdateManager`) — Immortal polls [`version.json`](version.json); when it
  advertises a higher `versionCode`, it downloads and installs the new build over itself. No
  cable, no laptop.
- **Provisioning kit** ([`provisioning/`](provisioning/)) — one double-click per device: installs
  Immortal, optionally sets it as the home screen and screensaver, and can freeze OS updates so
  the setup sticks. Fully reversible (`Restore-Portal` / `--restore`).

## Install on a Portal

The easiest path is the [provisioning kit](provisioning/): connect the Portal over USB-C with
ADB enabled, then double-click `Provision-Portal` (macOS/Linux) or `Provision-Portal.bat`
(Windows). It fetches the latest release automatically.

To build from source instead:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.immortal.launcher/.HomeActivity
```

## On first-gen Portals (Portal+ Gen-1, Android 9)

Immortal runs on the original Portal+ too — launcher, screensaver, and app store all work. There's
one quirk worth knowing up front, because it's a quirk of that hardware's older software, not a
fault in Immortal:

**The first-gen Portal's built-in Android installer is broken** (it opens a dialog with no
buttons), so apps can't be installed the normal way. Immortal works around this with a small helper
that the provisioning kit starts over USB — after that, the app store, "Install with Immortal," and
sideloading all install silently with no dialog.

That helper can't survive a reboot on this generation (a limitation of running without root on
Android 9 — the same reason tools like Shizuku need re-starting). So **after the Portal restarts,
installing *new* apps is paused until you reconnect it to a computer and run the installer again** —
a 30-second step. Everything else keeps working across reboots: your home screen, screensaver, and
every app you've already installed. Because Portals have no battery and stay plugged in, they
reboot rarely, so in practice you set up your apps once and seldom touch this again. Immortal shows
a clear note in the store when installs are paused, so it's never a mystery.

The **Portal TV** is the same generation (Android 9), so the same install mechanics apply. It has
no touchscreen, but Immortal is fully driveable with the TV remote — the home grid, folders, App
Store, and screensaver settings all navigate with the D-pad.

Newer Portals (Portal Go, Mini, gen-2) have a working installer and don't need any of this — though
their silent-install helper also stops after a reboot, so a new app installed then goes through the
system dialog (and some Play-Store split apps won't parse there) until you re-run the kit. The store
shows a note when that happens.

### Play-Store apps via Aurora on a first-gen Portal

[Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com) lets you install Play-Store apps (Spotify, etc.) without a
Google account. On the Gen-1 Portal+ its two default installer modes — "Session" and "Native" —
both run into the broken stock installer, and unlike a file you download in Chrome, Aurora keeps
its APK in private storage where Immortal's helper can't reach it. The path that *does* work is
Aurora's **Shizuku** installer, which installs through the same privileged channel Immortal uses.

The provisioning kit sets most of this up for you: on a Gen-1 Portal it **installs Shizuku and
starts its server automatically** (it skips this on newer Portals, which don't need it). So all
that's left is to point Aurora at it, a one-time, two-tap step:

1. Install **Aurora Store** from the Immortal App Store.
2. In **Aurora → Settings → Installation → Installation method**, choose **Shizuku installer**.
   The first install prompts "Allow Aurora Store to access Shizuku?" — tap **Allow all the time**.

After that, Aurora installs Play-Store apps silently, including split APKs — no dialog, no broken
installer (verified end-to-end on a Portal+ installing Spotify). Shizuku's server, like Immortal's
own helper, doesn't survive a reboot; the kit restarts it on its next run, or run
`./provision.sh --shizuku` (`provision.ps1 -Shizuku`).

## Releasing

Hosted from this repo:

- [`version.json`](version.json) — the self-update manifest. Bump `versionCode`/`versionName`,
  build a signed release, and attach it as `immortal.apk` to a GitHub Release; devices update on
  their next check.
- [`catalog.json`](catalog.json) — the app-store catalog. Edit and commit; clients pick it up on
  next open (a bundled copy ships as the offline fallback).

Release builds must be signed with the **same** key every time (in-place self-update is
signature-checked). Signing is configured via a git-ignored `keystore.properties`; keep that key
backed up safely — losing it means devices can no longer self-update.

## Limitations (the honest list)

These are hardware/firmware limits of the Portal itself, confirmed on-device — not things a future
Immortal release can fix:

- **No Google Play Services.** The Portal never had them, and they can't be added (it would need
  Google's own signed software, or system-level write access we don't have). Aurora Store installs
  plenty of apps that work fine, but anything that depends on Google for sign-in, push
  notifications, or DRM may be limited or won't run. microG isn't an option either — the firmware
  has no signature-spoofing support.
- **The bootloader can't be unlocked, so there's no root.** Meta ships the standard "OEM unlocking"
  developer toggle, but the bootloader hard-refuses (`Flashing Unlock is not allowed`) even with it
  enabled, and there's no manufacturer unlock program. This is why the first-gen install helper
  can't be made permanent — root was the only path, and it's welded shut.
- **USB-C thumb drives don't mount reliably.** On the Portal Go the port switches to host mode and a
  drive powers up and enumerates, but the storage stack doesn't bind it, so it doesn't appear as a
  folder. Put screensaver photos on the device's own storage instead (e.g. copy them across while
  it's plugged into your computer).
